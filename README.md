# Must Watch

The inspiration for creating this project came from JavaScript must watch repos. Being a Software Engineer, I spend majority on my time on Building & Breaking code, [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), enjoying rapidly evolving JavaScript ecosystem and keeping myself up-to-date with latest industry tooling & practices.

To overcome the burnt out feeling and keep myself motivated, I used to watch many YouTube videos, and if found good share with close friends and family members. Eventually I realized these could be helpful for others also.

So, here are the list of curated videos which I can watch repeatedly üîÅ:
