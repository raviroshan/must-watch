# Must Watch

This project is highly inspired by [JavaScript must watch repo](https://github.com/bolshchikov/js-must-watch). Being a Software Engineer, I spend my major hours building & breaking code, Stackoverflow, cherishing ever changing JavaScript ecosystem and keeping pace with the latest industry tools & best practices.

To overcome the 🔥 burnt out feeling, 😞 failures and keep myself motivated 🚀, I used to watch many YouTube videos, and if found really worth, shared with close friends and family members. Eventually I realized these could be helpful for others as well.

So, here is the list of curated videos which I can watch repeatedly 🔁:
